# Why do this?

## Guidance on Best Practices for HTTP servers, clients and intermediaries.

Lots of time and effort have been spent learning and getting these experiences
and this knowledge. This document should help lowering the bar for new
implementers.

## Advice for implementors. 

## More than just "Kernel Settings"
---
# Status

## Version -01  used in CfA. Mostly positive feedback

## Draft updated to move system specific settings into Appendix.

## Added wording 
---
# Comments

## Seperate into client, server, and both

### Does make sense to separate the guidance between clients and servers. 
### Initially considering the server case.

---
# WG Next Steps?

## Willing to help Daniel moving work forward.

## Up for WG to adopt, etc.

# Thanks
